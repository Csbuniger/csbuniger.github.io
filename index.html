								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Thank you for taking the time to peruse this portfolio of my recent work. I have included projects that concisely represent the breadth of my geospatial knowledge and hope that this collection serves as the beginning to a more in-depth conversation about how we could mutually benefit from working together.</p>
								<p>I am a naturally curious person who genuinely enjoys learning and have been a lifelong student. My education includes an Associate of Applied Science in Manufacturing, a Bachelor of Science in Land Use with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems and have recently matriculated with a Master of Engineering in Geomatics. I have worked full-time throughout my academic career and have consistently been placed in positions of responsibility wherever I have been employed. Most recently I managed the Machining department at Excalibur Machine in Colorado Springs. This position required the direct supervision of eight employees in an Aerospace manufacturing setting and I am responsible for the oversight of work from the initial bid until the time it leaves our dock. I am particularly proud of the work I did as the Senior Draftsman for Superior Walls of the Rockies. In this position I incorporated information from customers, architects, structural engineers, geotechnical engineers, and individual county building departments into a comprehensive drawing package that was reviewed by a Professional Engineer on a site-by-site basis.  I specifically designed these drawing packages to include information for the in-house yard crew about how to build the product to satisfy the unique building loads, information for the customer about how to prepare the site, specifications for the County so they could evaluate the suitability of the design and details for the on-site set crew about how to install the product correctly. The CAD skills I learned early on proved invaluable when I worked as a subcontractor digitizing existing conditions for a telecommunications firm. In this position I worked with the client to provide drawing packages identifying assets and incorporating design elements along the routes that they were to install fiber optic infrastructure on.</p>
								<p>Throughout both my academic and professional careers I have created many graphically rich products of varying scale and complexity which have been used to derive solutions for specific problems and communicate information.  The Land Use Bachelor of Science degree with a GIS concentration and the Master of Engineering in Geomatics course of study specifically address the qualifications required to be successful in the Geospatial industry. The Land Use curriculum at Metropolitan State emphasized historical as well as contemporary planning and community development issues, solutions, and trends. I have recently completed graduate level courses at the University of Colorado including topics in Geomatics, Geospatial Data Development, GIS Relational Databases, Transportation applications, LiDAR data and Interactive Web Mapping. The technical orientation of these programs have exposed me to the full spectrum of GIS functionality and emphasized the need process data in such a manner that maintains fidelity through the consistent application of established practices and thorough documentation</p>

							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major">CDOT Operations</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This project mapped the location of Noxious Weeds that grow within the right-of-way that is maintained by the Colorado Department of Transportation. The datasets used to determine these locations contained data regarding many species of flora, not all of which require abatement. This data was compiled by different people over a period of time and was very inconsistent. Collating and organizing the tabular data was the primary challenge of this project.</p>
								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Joins, data creation from selection, calculating statistics and queries by location and attribute. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Sidewalk Accessibility</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>One aspect of the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that cities identify and address sidewalk conditions within their boundaries. This project analyzed data within Denver city limits to determine the topology of the sidewalk network and the prevalence of various sidewalk widths.
								</p> 
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>This resulted in a sidewalk availability score which was aggregated by Census block and could be used to identify areas that potentially run afoul of the ADA.</p>

								<p><i>Skills used</i>: ArcGIS Pro functions including: Database creation/ population, reprojection of datasets, geoprocessing to identify right-of-ways including clipping, dissolving and buffering of features, spatial joins, calculating statistics, creating new datasets from pertinent information and cartographic presentation.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Sentinal 2 Data</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>At the time, the European Space Agency had recently began disseminating remotely sensed data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and this project examined the parallels with the data collected by the long-running NASA LandSAT missions. The sensor onboard the Sentinel satellite collects data at different wavelengths (bands) than the LandSAT sensor and I sought to identify and combine the bands to create analogous products. These images included Natural Color, Near Infrared, and the Tasseled Cap Transform (shown above).</p>

								<p><a href="images/REMOTE SENSING.pdf">Link to a PDF of the report</a></p>

								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Introduction to ERDAS Imagine software, Clipping imagery to an area of interest, creating "stacks" of imagery to display imagery in different ways and band math to derive information from data.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Multitemporal Study</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Classifying and monitoring the amount and vigor of vegetative growth is one aspect of effective land management that the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) contribute greatly to. This report used both of these tools to examine LandSAT-8 data over one growing season and conclude that both the TCT and NDVI provide complementary products for identifying, quantifying, and classifying data.</p>
								
								<p><a href="images/REMOTE SENSING-Multitemporal.pdf">Link to a PDF of the report</a></p>

								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Convert Digital Numbers (DN) to top of atmosphere reflectance values, perform Dark Object Subtraction atmospheric correction, create Tasseled Cap and NDVI products and perform statistical analysis.</p>

								<h2 class="major">CAD</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For this project I employed AutoCAD Map to complete mapping and design work for a small telecommunications company with projects in Arizona and Texas. I utilized medium resolution satellite imagery to digitize existing infrastructure along the proposed installation corridor. The CAD data I provided was used to identify poles that overhead fiber optic lines would be installed on as well as areas that would require underground installation. This information was used extensively during the planning phase and when negotiating crossing agreements with landowners. I was acting as an independent contractor and still own my full commercial copy of AutoCAD Map.</p>
								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Customer relations, digitizing from imagery, AutoCAD Model space/ Paper space layouts, and telecommunications design principals.</p>

								<!--<h2 class="major">Web Mapping</h2>

								<h2 class="major">UAV</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This project was spearheaded by Jupiter Unmanned as part of the UAV class taught by their CEO, Jeff Cozart. As students we did the pertinent preflight reconnaissance, prepared flight plans in UgCS and processed the data that was collected in the field. The field data included corrected RTK survey-grade control points (GCP) as well as the data acquired by the DJI Inspire Drone. The results incorporated the GCPs to produce georeferenced imagery as well as a Digital Surface Model.</p>

								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Universal Ground Control (UgCS) flight programming software, Pix4d photogrammetry software, Global Mapper imagery software.</p>

								<h2 class="major">GPS</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This project was undertaken to identify the workflow and processes associated with gathering topographical information. GPS points were collected in a grid pattern across the Area of Interest and the Digital Surface Model shown above was generated using the different interpolation methods available in ArcGIS. </p>

								<p><a href="images/TOPO.pdf">Link to a PDF of the report</a></p>

								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Data collection with Trimble equipment, creation of data dictionaries, objective comparison of surface interpolation methods, and presentation of results.</p>

								<h2 class="major">LiDAR</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The above image was created for my Geomatics class and involved georeferencing and classifying LiDAR data in the open-source program Cloud Compare. The image depicts a football stadium with a river in the background.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Currently I am taking a class on LiDAR and this image is of the point cloud generated by a tripod mounted terrestrial scanner. The yellow triangles represent the locations the scans were acquired from and the color gradient applied to the points indicates height in meters.</p>
								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Import, register, and classify airborne and terrestrial LiDAR data using Cloud Compare and Trimble RealWorks software.</p>

								<h2 class="major">DATABASING</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The above image shows the result of a mapping exercise that was undertaken using open-source software and, with the exception of the cartographic output, executed entirely within the PostgreSQL  environment using PostGIS/Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) commands. This project relied on an abstract computing environment to execute commands that the effects of were not immediately observable. </p>
								<p><i>Skills used</i>: Employed SQL/OGC commands to create a local database, populate this database with vector data, re-project datasets to a common EPSG value, create buffer zones along line vector data and identify points within buffer zones. Used QGIS to create cartographic products.</p>
